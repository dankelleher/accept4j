#summary How to download and run the example projects

[http://accept4j.googlecode.com/files/examples.zip examples.zip] contains set of directories, each containing an example project using a different spec type.

To run an example:

  * Download and extract [http://accept4j.googlecode.com/files/examples.zip examples.zip]
  * Pick a spec type and open the associated directory 
  * Open a terminal at the root of this directory
  * Run the ant build script included (just type `ant`, and the default build task will run)
 OR
If you don't want to use ant, just use javac, including the jars in the lib/ directory on your classpath:

{{{
javac -d out -classpath lib/accept4j.jar;lib/junit-4.10.jar src\org\exampleprog\test\*.java
}}}
