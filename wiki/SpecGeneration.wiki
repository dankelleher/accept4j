#summary Instructions on how to generate your specifications or list of test cases

=Introduction=

Accept4j takes a set of specifications, or test cases, from the business, and produces a report indicating which have been implemented in the code base. Specifications can come from a number of sources:

  * Excel spreadsheet
  * Directory structure
  * [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/ Atlassian JIRA] issue tracking software
  * XML file

See below for details on creating specs using each of these methods.

=Excel=

Include an excel file called `spec.xls` in the [SpecGeneration#Working_Directory working directory], following [http://accept4j.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testData/functional/excelspec/spec.xls this template].

The tests should either be in a sheet called `spec` or the first sheet in the workbook.

=Directory structure=

Create a directory called `spec` in your [SpecGeneration#Working_Directory working directory]. The directories inside it will define your test structure. Use the template:

{{{
spec/<test suite name>/<group name>/<test pack name>/<test file>
}}}

http://accept4j.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/directoryStructure.png

The files in the test pack folders should be named:

_Test ID_`_`_Test Name_._extension_

for example: `1.1_the client should be billed.docx`

[http://code.google.com/p/accept4j/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FtestData%2Ffunctional%2Fdirspec%2Fspec See this example]

The spec files are not read by accept4j, so can be whatever format or file type you like. It is currently not possible to include test descriptions in the report using a directory structure spec.

=JIRA=

_JIRA integration is currently experimental and does not provide all the fuctionality of the other spec options. Group and test pack naming is not yet supported._

  # Include a copy of [http://accept4j.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testData/functional/jiraspec/jira.config jira.config] in your [SpecGeneration#Working_Directory working directory].
  # Edit jira.config with the URL of your own JIRA installation, and a username and password (note: encrypted passwords is not supported, so use a generic, read-only JIRA account here)
  # Ensure the RPC plugin is enabled on your JIRA installation, by following instructions [https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+XML-RPC+Overview#JIRAXML-RPCOverview-EnabletheRPCplugin here].
  # Create an issue filter in JIRA that selects all the issues you wish to include in your spec. Put the [SpecGeneration#JIRA_filter_ID filter ID] in the `jira.config` file.

accept4j includes only subtask issue types in the spec. To ensure an issue is included, make sure it is set up as a subtask of a parent issue.

=Notes=

===Working Directory===

The _working directory_ is whatever directory you run the java compiler from. 

===JIRA filter ID===

Get the ID of the JIRA issues filter from the URL of the filter. 

`https://jira.atlassian.com/issues/?filter=<filter ID>`

Select the filter from the Issues menu.

http://accept4j.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/filterSelection.png

The URL of the resultant page will give you the filter ID.
