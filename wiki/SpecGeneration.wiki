#summary Instructions on how to generate your specifications or list of test cases

=Introduction=

Accept4j takes a set of specifications, or test cases, from the business, and produces a report indicating which have been implemented in the code base. Specifications can come from a number of sources:

  * Excel spreadsheet
  * Directory structure
  * [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/ Atlassian JIRA] issue tracking software
  * XML file

See below for details on creating specs using each of these methods.

=Excel=

Include an excel file called ´spec.xml´ in the [SpecGeneration#Working_Directory working directory], following [http://code.google.com/p/accept4j/source/browse/trunk/testData/functional/excelspec/spec.xls this template].

The _working directory_ is whatever directory you run the java compiler from.
