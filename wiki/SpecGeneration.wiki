#summary Instructions on how to generate your specifications or list of test cases

=Introduction=

Accept4j takes a set of specifications, or test cases, from the business, and produces a report indicating which have been implemented in the code base. Specifications can come from a number of sources:

  * Excel spreadsheet
  * Directory structure
  * [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/ Atlassian JIRA] issue tracking software
  * XML file

See below for details on creating specs using each of these methods.

=Excel=

Include an excel file called `spec.xls` in the [SpecGeneration#Working_Directory working directory], following [http://accept4j.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testData/functional/excelspec/spec.xls this template].

The tests should either be in a sheet called `spec` or the first sheet in the workbook.

=Directory structure=

Create a directory called `spec` in your [SpecGeneration#Working_Directory working directory]. The directories inside it will define your test structure. Use the template:

{{{
"spec" => test suite name => group name => test pack name => test file
}}}

The files in the test pack folders should be named:

_Test ID_`_`_Test Name_._extension_

for example: `1.1_the client should be billed.docx`

===Working Directory===

The _working directory_ is whatever directory you run the java compiler from.
